            The mechanical design or the Pop-It bubble popper was originally
            <br />
            invented in 1975 by Theo and Ora Coster of Theora Concepts: a<br />
            married Israeli couple who had invented many games including Guess
            <br />
            Who? and Zingo!. Incidentally, Theo was a former classmate of Anne
            <br />
            Frank. According to the BBC, inspiration for its design came from a
            <br />
            dream Ora Coster had when her sister, an artist, passed away from
            <br />
            breast cancer. Recounting his mother`s words, Ora`s son, Boaz
            <br />
            Coster, has said: "She said, 'Theo, imagine a large field of
            <br />
            breasts, that you can push the nipple' She went to him and said do a
            <br />
            carpet of nipples that you can press from one side to the other. And
            <br />
            he did just that.‚Äù
